# AGENTS.md

This repository is for DragonBoat, a local-first crew layer for cross-platform coding agents.

## Communication

- Use Chinese when conversing with the project owner unless they request another language.
- Write project-facing documentation in English by default.
- Keep README, architecture, protocol, schema, and agent-facing docs concise and agent-readable.

## Product Direction

DragonBoat is not a generic agent wrapper. Its center of gravity is coordination semantics:

- crew identity
- task packets
- peer-to-peer mailbox messages
- evidence bundles
- local event logs
- command-deck replay

The v0.1 demo direction is:

- Codex CLI acts as the steerer.
- Claude Code CLI acts as rower workers.
- Three rowers handle frontend, backend, and QA/Ops work.
- Each worker uses an isolated worktree.
- The desktop surface shows progress, mailbox traffic, evidence, and replay.

Treat this demo stack as the first proof, not as the permanent architecture. DragonBoat must remain cross-platform and user-owned.

## Current Phase

The repository is in day-one design and documentation mode.

Do not introduce implementation code, dependencies, generated apps, or framework choices unless the current task explicitly asks for implementation.

The current v0.1 implementation baseline is documented in:

- `docs/v0.1-data-contracts.md`
- `docs/adapters/codex-cli.md`
- `docs/adapters/claude-code-cli.md`
- `docs/v0.1-technical-decisions.md`
- `schemas/v0/*.schema.json`

## Design Principles

- Local-first before cloud-first.
- Cross-platform before vendor-specific convenience.
- Evidence before claims.
- User-owned model routing before provider lock-in.
- Small verifiable tasks before autonomous mega-runs.
- Desktop as command deck and replay surface, not as an agent configuration replacement.

## Implementation Guardrails

When implementation begins:

- Prefer the repo's existing patterns over new abstractions.
- Keep agent adapters separated from core crew/task/evidence semantics.
- Validate task packets and evidence bundles against `schemas/v0`.
- Keep worker outputs auditable: commands, logs, diffs, failures, and risks.
- Avoid hidden destructive operations.
- Never assume all agents support the same real-time control APIs.
- Use soft real-time delivery where needed: hooks/plugins when available, polling when necessary.
